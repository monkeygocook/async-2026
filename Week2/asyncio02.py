# Program 2: The Coroutine Object
# Concept: Seeing that calling an async def function creates an "Object" but does not execute it yet.
import asyncio

async def greet():
    print("Hello!")

coro_object = greet()  # Calling the async def function creates a coroutine object
print(type(coro_object))  # <class 'coroutine'>
coro_object  # This is a coroutine object, not executed yet
